1. Generate a data that could be linearly classified
X = np.array([
    [-2,4],
    [4,1],
    [1,6],
    [2,4],
    [6,2],
])

# Associated output labels
# First 2 are labeled -1 and last 3 are 1
y = np.array([-1,-1,1,1,1])

2. Visualize the data
3. Now initialize the variables like learning_rate, weights, epochs
4. Take a empty list to store errors.
5. Start Iterations on epochs
6. Take a variable error inside loop and initialize it with 0.
7. Use if condition to check whether weights are missclassified or not
8. If weights are missclassified than change the value of error from 0 to 1.
9. Append error into errors.
10. Else if weights are classified correctly than init error with 0 again.
11. Now after completing iterations return errors and weights
